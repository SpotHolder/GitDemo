# GitDemo
Homework-madatory git repository to "learn git"

### Case Scenario

`@holazzer` is a programer(me) and he is trying to learn how to use sci-kit learn package `sklearn` and he built a simple demo. But he has trouble using `git`. He is so worried about losing his progress that he commits his code like,every line he writes.(And totally `NOT` because the homework requires at least 5 commits.)
